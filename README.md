Game Loader is a browser-based HTML editor that allows users to paste, edit, and run complete HTML files instantly. The editor includes a live preview pane that displays the output in a secure sandboxed environment, making it ideal for testing HTML games, webpages, and small JavaScript projects. Users can run their code, open it in a new tab, or download it as an HTML file with a single click.

## Features

## Purpose

Game Loader is designed for students, developers, and hobbyists who want a fast and simple way to test HTML projects without installing additional tools. It is useful for game testing, web development practice, classroom demonstrations, and rapid prototyping.

## Technology

This tool runs entirely in the browser using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend or server is required, and projects can run offline once loaded.
